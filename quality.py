-----------

Stub module for photo quality and defect detection.  In a complete
implementation this would send images to a YOLOv10 model to identify
cracks, spalling, PPE compliance issues or other safety defects.  For
the demo this endpoint simply acknowledges receipt of the file.

Endpoint:

POST /quality/analyze

Body:
  - file: Uploaded image

Returns:
  JSON with a placeholder message
