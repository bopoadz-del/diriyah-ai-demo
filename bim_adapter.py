Stub functions for matching geolocated photos to BIM elements and
updating the model.  In a production system this would query your
BIM database (e.g. IFC model, Navisworks or Autodesk Construction
Cloud) to find the nearest element and update its status.

Functions:

* ``map_photo_to_bim(coords: dict, project_id: str)`` â†’ example match
